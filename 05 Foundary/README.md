# 05 Foundary

The Foundary is where ideas are forged into permanent notes — your Zettelkasten.

## What is a Zettelkasten?

A system of atomic, interconnected notes:
- **Atomic** — one idea per note
- **Permanent** — written to last and evolve
- **Linked** — connected to other notes, creating a web of knowledge
- **Your words** — not copied, but understood and restated

## What goes here

✅ Insights from reading, conversations, or thinking
✅ Concepts you want to remember and build on
✅ Ideas that connect to other ideas

## What doesn't go here

❌ Raw inputs → 00 Inbox
❌ Topic overviews → 08 Topics  
❌ Project notes → 01 Projects
❌ Reference material → 03 Resources

## Note format

```markdown
---
type: zettel
created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
tags: []

# Title (the idea in a phrase)

The idea explained in your own words.

## Links

- [[Related note]]
- [[Another connection]]
```

## How it connects

```
08 Topics (hubs)     →  05 Foundary (atoms)  →  each other
   AI.md            links to    "LLMs predict tokens.md"
   Productivity.md  links to    "Spaced repetition beats cramming.md"
```

Topics organize and link. Foundary notes are the actual insights.

## Naming

Use a timestamp prefix for chronological ordering:
- `202602041630 - LLMs predict next token.md`
- `202602041645 - Spaced repetition beats cramming.md`

Or just use descriptive titles if you prefer.
