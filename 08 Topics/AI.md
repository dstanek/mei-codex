# AI

Artificial Intelligence — systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

## Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning** — systems that learn from data
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — AI trained on text to generate/understand language
- **Prompt Engineering** — crafting inputs to get better AI outputs
- **Agents** — AI systems that can take actions autonomously
