# 08 Topics

**Tag Notes** — notes that define and consolidate a topic.

## What is a Tag Note?

Instead of using tags scattered across files, create a dedicated note for each important topic. This note:

1. **Defines** the topic (what it is, why it matters)
2. **Links** to related notes, projects, and resources
3. **Summarizes** key insights you've learned
4. **Lists** open questions or areas to explore

## When to Create a Tag Note

Create a tag note when:
- You have 3+ notes touching the same topic
- A topic keeps coming up in your work
- You want to build expertise in an area
- You need a "home base" for scattered knowledge

## Structure

Each tag note follows this pattern:

```markdown
---
type: topic
aliases: [alternate names]
---

# Topic Name

Brief definition or summary.

## Key Concepts

The main ideas or frameworks.

## Related Notes

Links to notes that explore this topic.

## Resources

External links, books, courses.

## Open Questions

What you still want to learn.
```

## Current Topics

See the notes in this folder for topics already defined.
