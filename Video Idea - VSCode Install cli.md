## The Easy Way

1. **Open VS Code Insiders** from your Applications folder (double-click it)
2. **Open the Command Palette**: Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (or `⇧⌘P`)
3. **Type** `shell command` and select:
    - **"Shell Command: Install 'code-insiders' command in PATH"**
	1. **Restart your terminal** and you should be able to use `code-insiders` from the command line; auto complete might not work until you start a new shell
