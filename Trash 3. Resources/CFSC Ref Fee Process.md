## Requirements

1. Have your game listed in the google sheet - **must include date, opponent name and ref $ amount**
2. Prior withdrawals must have details noted in the memo section of the transaction in PlayMetrics. The memo **must** include: GAME DATE, OPPONENT NAME, $ amt. If for your own notes, you want to include league game # fine but you must include the other details so I can match to the google sheet.
3. Make sure all your fall money has been withdrawn. I know a lot of games were played without refs so I do think this is likely caught up.   

## Step-by-step process

### Game Information
1. Team Managers will put games on the google sheet.

2. If you’re not comfortable inserting a line by your other games, feel free to add it to the bottom of the list on the appropriate tab for your team

3. Every Monday, I will refer to the sheet to distribute $ for games added since the last time and/or upcoming games. I will put a date on the sheet when I transfer the $


## Withdrawal Locations
-  **Currently, ATMS at Sheetz and Speedway gas stations appear to all be fee-free**. On the google sheet, there is a tab where I have kept track of locations you have successfully used. Some Sheetz are even known to give out denominations other than just $20s. There may be more but these I have found based on what you have withdrawn.

### After A Withdrawal
1. Go into PlayMetrics (make sure you’re in Team Staff role) and Team Accounts. 
2. Click on the Transaction for the Withdrawal
   * ***In the Memo section add: Date vs Opponent Name ($ amt)**. For example, on a $30 withdrawal you would add: 11/2 vs Internationals ($15), 11/3 vs Force White ($15) HIT SAVE
3. Go to **Reconcile** (in the upper right of the transaction box - see attached screenshot) **and choose the EXPENSE** that matches the withdrawal (pick the EXPENSE not the INCOME). You can even split the Reconcile categories (for instance if you withdrew for a league game and a scrimmage) 

> [!note]
> If your game ends up not requiring all the money you withdrew (ie refs didn’t show), you can edit your memos. You can also include a note that you’re carrying over $X to the next game (for instance, if you have to get our $20s but only need $35 you’d say that $5 is going towards the game on DATE)

### After Games
1. Go into the Google Sheet and make a note if you didn’t use all your ref money (or if you planned on withdrawing later but I’d already transferred it), make a note of the difference (don’t change the original amount for anything I have transferred) 
    - For instance, we marked $70 for a Pre-ECNL game but you only had to pay $40. Make a note that you have an extra $30 in the far right column for this game. 
- This will allow me to help you keep track of all the inconsistencies. With these notes you don’t have to edit the Memo line in PlayMetrics but I know some of you will like to do that too.
