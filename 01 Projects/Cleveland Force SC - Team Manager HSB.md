## Winter Session
I'm
- [Force Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BJmNalvNau7Q4hCboVLaZ2gDF2Y9FOaicifBuls-2ww/edit?gid=16821756#gid=16821756) for listing games
- Winter [schedule](https://system.gotsport.com/org_event/events/46853/schedules?team=3558273)


**AFTER A WITHDRAWAL:**

- Go into PlayMetrics (make sure you’re in Team Staff role) and Team Accounts.  
- Click on the Transaction for the Withdrawal
- In the Memo section add: Date vs Opponent Name ($ amt). For example, on a $30 withdrawal you would add: 11/2 vs Internationals ($15), 11/3 vs Force White ($15)  HIT SAVE
- That's all the information I need. If you'd like to add additional details, that's fine but I have to have those basics.
- I don't have league schedules so just having a game # doesn't help me or accounting.
- Then go to Reconcile (in the upper right of the transaction box ) and choose the EXPENSE that matches the withdrawal.  Pick the EXPENSE not the INCOME. You can even split the Reconcile categories (for instance if you withdrew for a league game and a scrimmage) 
- If your game ends up not requiring all the money you withdrew (ie refs didn’t show), you can edit your memos. You can also include a note that you’re carrying over $X to the next game (for instance, if you have to get our $20s but only need $35 you’d say that $5 is going towards the game on DATE)

  

**AFTER GAMES:**

- Go into the Google Sheet and make a note if you didn’t use all your ref money and make a note of the difference (don’t change the original amount for anything I have transferred)  
- For instance, we marked $70 for a Pre-ECNL game but you only had to pay $40. Make a note that you have an extra $30 in the far right column for this game. 
- This will allow me to help you keep track of all the inconsistencies. With these notes you don’t have to edit the Memo line in PlayMetrics but I know some of you will like to do that too. 

  

**The adding notes in the memo area is very important from an accounting standpoint. The company hands out a large amount of cash and needs the details to back up the funds. We are able to run transaction reports which includes the memo section - hence the need for it.**
  

If anyone has any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! Email either directly (hdenoi@tocafootball.com) or through PlayMetrics is best. The chat doesn't work well for me since I have to be logged into that specific club to see it and I work for 3 TOCA clubs.
