## Highlights
### Location 269

> What if, instead, we treated software more like a valuable, productive plant, to be nurtured, pruned, harvested, fertilized, and watered?

 * [Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=269)
### Location 292

> We have something working at all times, making sure that the code is always as well-structured as possible and thoroughly tested.

 * [Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=292)
### Location 300

> Writing a test first forces us to clarify our intentions, and we don’t start the next piece of work until we have an unambiguous description of what it should do. The process of writing a test first helps us see when a design is too rigid or unfocused. Then, when we want to follow through and fix a design flaw, the tests give us a safety net of regression coverage.

 * [Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=300)
### Location 306

> We’ve seen teams that write tests and code at about the same time (and even teams that write the tests first) where the code is a mess and the tests just raise the cost of maintenance.

 * [Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=306)
### Location 308

> let the tests guide development.

 * [Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=308)
### Location 386

> Testing is no longer just about keeping defects from the users; instead, it’s about helping the team to understand the features that the users need and to deliver those features reliably and predictably.

 * [Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=386)

### Location 415

> In each cycle it adds new features and gets feedback about the quantity and quality of the work already done.

 * [Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=415)
### Location 420

> we apply feedback cycles at every level of development, organizing projects as a system of nested loops ranging from seconds to months, such as: pair programming, unit tests, acceptance tests, daily meetings, iterations, releases, and so on.

> “I was finally able to separate logical from physical design. I’d always been told to do that but no one ever explained how.”

 * [Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=452)
### Location 605

> Object-oriented design focuses more on the communication between objects than on the objects themselves.

 * [Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=605)
### Location 612

> An object-oriented system is a web of collaborating objects. A system is built by creating objects and plugging them together so that they can send messages to one another. The behavior of the system is an emergent property of the composition of the objects—the choice of objects and how they are connected

 * [Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=612)
### Location 617

> The code we write to manage this composition is a declarative definition of the how the web of objects will behave. It’s easier to change the system’s behavior because we can focus on what we want it to do, not how.

 * [Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=617)
### Location 624

> Values are immutable instances that model fixed quantities. They have no individual identity,

 * [Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=624)
### Location 628

> Objects, on the other hand, use mutable state to model their behavior over time. Two objects of the same type have separate identities

 * [Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=628)
### Location 637

> this means that they follow common communication patterns and that the dependencies between them are made explicit. A communication pattern is a set of rules that govern how a group of objects talk to each other: the roles they play, what messages they can send and when, and so on.

 * [Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=637)
### Location 642

> in terms of its dynamic, communication structure is a significant mental shift from the static classification

 * [Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=642)
### Location 662

> At worst, we’ve seen too many codebases (including our own) that suffer complexity and duplication from using one mechanism to represent multiple concepts.

 * [Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=662)
### Location 666

> An object is an implementation of one or more roles; a role is a set of related responsibilities; and a responsibility is an obligation to perform a task or know information. A collaboration is an interaction of objects or roles (or both).

 * [Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=666)

### Location 926

> nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate it.

 * [Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=926)
### Location 945

> Because the need for end-to-end testing had not influenced its design, the system was difficult to test.

 * [Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=945)
### Location 965

> The point of the “walking skeleton” is to use the writing of the first test to draw out the context of the project, to help the team map out the landscape of their solution—the essential decisions that they must take before they can write any code;

 * [Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=965)
### Location 987

> No tests are perfect, of course, but in practice we’ve found that a substantial test suite allows us to make major changes safely.

 * [Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=987)
### Location 1037

> We write the acceptance test using only terminology from the application’s domain, not from the underlying technologies (such as databases or web servers).

 * [Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1037)
### Location 1042

> We find that writing such a test before coding makes us clarify what we want to achieve.

### Location 1043

> The precision of expressing requirements in a form that can be automatically checked helps us uncover implicit assumptions.

### Location 1045

> starting with tests makes us look at the system from the users’ point of view, understanding what they need it to do rather than speculating about features from the implementers’ point of view.

 * [Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1052)
### Location 1054

### Location 1187

> Because we cannot predict when we will have to change any particular part of the system, we gather together code that will change for the same reason.

### Location 1213

> Encapsulation Ensures that the behavior of an object can only be affected through its API.

 * [Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1213)
### Location 1223

> Objects can break encapsulation by sharing references to mutable objects, an effect known as aliasing.

### Location 1236

> If we expose too much of an object’s internals through its API, its clients will end up doing some of its work.

### Location 1252

> Loosely speaking, we use the message-passing style we’ve just described between objects, but we tend to use a more functional style within an object, building up behavior from methods and values that have no side effects.

 * [Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1252)
### Location 1262

> Our heuristic is that we should be able to describe what an object does without using any conjunctions (“and,” “or”).

 * [Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1262)

> The API of a composite object should not be more complicated than that of any of its components.

 * [Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1322)
### Location 1329

> A system is easier to change if its objects are context-independent; that is, if each object has no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes.

 * [Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TIOYVW&location=1329)
