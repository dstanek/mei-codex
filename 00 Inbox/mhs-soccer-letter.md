To Whom It May Concern,

The Mentor High boys soccer program is run extremely poorly. It's actually very sad
that there are so many highly dedicated soccer players that are having their high
school playing experience destroyed. Many parents feel the same way and complain on
the sidelines, but nobody wants to speak up. Nobody wants to risk retailiation against
their son. That's why this letter is anonymous.
