Agentic systems are really distributed systems with the extra complication that LLMs are actually completely stateless.

LLMs:
* Very high latency
* Very high variability
* Some unreliability

LLMs can analyze, reason and plan
Agents are there to retrieve the context for an LLM so it can make better decisions
