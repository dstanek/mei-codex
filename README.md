Hi Emmett!

This is where I'll document how that data is used an organized.

## About Me

1. I am a husband and father of 4.
2. I am a Principle Software Engineer at [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/). That is my full-time job.
3. I teach Python programming to non-tech students (Business/Marketing/etc.) at Case Western Reserve University.
4. I am working on launching an education business.
5. I am a team manager for a club soccer team.

## Purpose

This Obsidian vault is my second brain.

## Organization

I am using my own take that combines the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) with [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/). I have been organizing my folders similar to PARA. The "99 Foundary" folder is where I will be putting my Zettelkasten notes.

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00 Inbox        | There is where unprocessed notes will show up. They are to raw inputs into the system.                                              |
| 01 Projects     | PARA style projects. See "Projects" below.                                                                                          |
| 02 Areas        | PARA style areas.                                                                                                                   |
| 03 Resources    | PARA style resources.                                                                                                               |
| 04 Archive      | PARA style archive.                                                                                                                 |
| 05 TCP Evidence | I am working toward a promotion at HPE. There is were I intend to plan and track my progress.                                       |
| 06 Study        | I think that was a false start and these notes should be migrated to "99 Foundary".                                                 |
| 07 Daily        | Daily notes should I ever start to actually write them.                                                                             |
| 08 Topics       | I think this is similar to "06 Study".                                                                                              |
| 09 YT           | A place for planning YouTube video content.                                                                                         |
| 10 Notes        | I was thinking I would use this for Zettlekaster, but now I'm not sure. I'm open to suggestions on this structure vs "99 Foundary". |
| 99 Copilot      | A sort of prompt library. Eventually, I would like to build an app. Maybe I need a project for this...                              |
| 99 Foundary     |                                                                                                                                     |
| 99 Meta         | Obsidian meta notes, like templates.                                                                                                |

## Projects

I really want to have a consistent organization and set of metadata for Projects. Ideally, i would like some way to differentiate between Personal, HPE, CWRU, and Learn Fast project. Probably an update to the dashboard to show them via a tag or other custom frontmatter.

## Where I need help

This is stuff I know I need help with:
1. Project organization and metadata
2. Overall organization
3. Look for missing ideas and content that needs to be explored, e.g gaps in knowledge
4. If I do something incorrectly or document something incorrectly, please call it out.

**What I'm NOT looking for**
1. I don't want you to process my "00 Inbox" unless I specifically ask for you to do something. The act of processing is how I learn and generate new ideas.
2. I don't want you to auto generate a lot of notes. These notes should be things I come up with and describe how i see the world.

## How to help

Make discreet pull requests for me to look at. They don't necessarily need to be small pull requests, but the should be focused to one specific thing. For example, "reorganized projects" and "added a list of missing topics" are good because I can evaluate each one separately. We can collaborate in the pull requests comments about specific changes.

For commit messages use the 50/72 rule and prefix the subject line with "emmett: ".
